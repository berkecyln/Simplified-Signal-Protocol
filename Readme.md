# Simplified Signal Protocol

This project is done for Cs411-507 Cryptography course in Sabanci University during Fall 2023.

It consisted three phases and at each phase, we implemented required features. The end result yielded a protocol that can be used for communication between two or more parties. Moreover, forward secrecy is achieved. 

It consists of multiple clients and a server, where server holds the public keys and ine time keys of clients and distributes necessary infroemation to other clients for session key creation. More details can be found in the [document](./CS411_507_Fall2023_Term_Project_Phase3.pdf).
